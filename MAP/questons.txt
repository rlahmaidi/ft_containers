1- why do we need an inputiterator in constructor, and form 
where will we get it since we don't have ours defined??
MY ANSWER: I THINK A RANDOM ACCESS AND A BIDERCTIRONEL ARE ALSO AN inputiterator;

2- iterator category and iterator_tag meaning and use????????

3- why do we take the pointer and refference defintion from allocator??;

4- rebind??? (begginnig of avll_tree);          √
5- pragma once vs ifndef;                       √

6- i need to see how to test any function that returns
an iterator and a const_iterator(?), lower_bound for example?
7 - how can we test the -> operator in random_access?;
8 - why can we call random_access without template parametre inside class definition;


9 - why do we need the parent for in avll_tree??
