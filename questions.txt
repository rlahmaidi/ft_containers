1- still need  to read a bit about the explicit keyword;
1 -inline function meaning ?;
3 - every function that have first last iterator should be tested with first > last 
with reverse iterator and with rand_acces(in mine and in std);
4 - read about const in different before and aftera a type, it is withly used;

5-      random_access operator-(difference_type const &n) const
        {
			ptr -= n;
            return (*this);
			
        }
i'm putting the const because we can't call a non-const function on a const object
(const iterator in mamoussa's test), but it shouldn't fucking work ,since we changed a data member(ptr)??
yet..... it does soldier.

6- still don't know how to test the operator-> in random_access;
7- when we add a interger to a  pointer why does it move us to the next element pointed
to by the pointer, is the + overloaded here;
8 - don't know how to test the const iterator without the vector;
9 - why can't we pass an iterator to the reverse iterator(only the type)?????
